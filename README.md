# Activity 1

## Purpose
The purpose of this lab is to get hands-on experience with NodeJS and submit a Hello World style application for my review.

## Hello
[![funny hello video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/PUjvaMWKeBI/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUjvaMWKeBI)

Using a text editor of your choice, create a Hello World application using NodeJS and Express that prints your Github handle, followed by a colon and your last name, first name in camel case. The server you create should be hosted on the localhost at port 3000. Your server should be able to be ran through the terminal commands "npm install" and "npm start".

If your GitHub handle were UsEr123 (case matters) and your name was John Doe, your output would look like this:

```
UsEr123:DoeJohn
```

## Submitting work
To submit the activity, simply push your server's code to your repository. Each person has .gitignore in their directory to avoid pushing additional dependencies.
